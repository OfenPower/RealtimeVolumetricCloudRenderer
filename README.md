# OpenGL Realtime Volumetric Cloud Renderer

This is a demo application which renders volumetric clouds in realtime through raymarching, combined with the preetham atmospheric scattering model, a free flight camera in order to fly through the clouds and an ImGUI UI Interface to control the rendering process. It is a simple, well commented and barebones project with all dependencies included which aims to demonstrate this specific volumetric cloud rendering technique to those interested. Just download the project and run the .exe file in the /bin folder to start the demo.

This volumetric clouds implementation is based on Andrew Schneiders article "Real-Time Volumetric Cloudscapes" from the book GPU Pro 7: Advanced Rendering Techniques (2016) and his follow-up presentations (see the above resource list for links).
